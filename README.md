# CPKD-PyTorch
The official pytorch implementation of **CPKD: Channel and Position-wise Knowledge Distillation for Segmentation of Negative Obstacles**. 

We test our code in Python 3.7, CUDA 11.1, cuDNN 8, and PyTorch 1.7.1. We provide `Dockerfile` to build the docker image we used. You can modify the `Dockerfile` as you want.  


# Introduction
CPKD is a knowledge distillation framework for the segmentation of positive obstacles which can transfer knowledge between two feature maps with different resolutions and channel numbers

# Code & Dataset
The Code and our released dataset will be uploaded in one week.
